# RecommenderSytemForPersonalizedLearningStrategies
This repository holds all the code of my Masters' degree thesis.


With the purpose of promoting behavior change and leveraging the students’ engagement in the courses’ activities, professors are beginning to integrate game elements into the classroom. However, usually in large collaborative educational environments, students are overwhelmed by the amount of available options and information, leading to an increased difﬁculty to perform informed choices. Furthermore, the “one-size-ﬁts-all” approach, which is implemented in a large portion of the studies, does not contemplate the individual differences between students. A promising way to deal with these challenges and enhance the guidance to ﬁnd and select the most suitable learning activities is by introducing recommender systems. This project’s scope focuses on creating/adapt algorithms that are capable of analyzing student’s proﬁles, previously identiﬁed, in the interest of building personalized teaching strategies that can maximize student’s performance in the proposed learning activities. Speciﬁcally, this thesis presents the development of a recommender system capable of suggesting speciﬁc course activities in the interest of supporting the student’s ascendance to the next proﬁle helping them to succeed in the course.
